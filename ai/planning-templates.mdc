# Planning Templates & Workflow

This file contains the full templates for plan files. It is referenced by `planning.mdc` when a new plan needs to be created.

---

## Directory Structure

Each initiative gets its own directory with two files:

```
{plans_dir}/{project-name}/
└── {initiative-name}/
    ├── plan.md        # What we intend to do
    └── log.md         # What actually happened during execution
```

Examples:
```
~/.ai-agent-plans/creator-hub/
├── feat-user-export/
│   ├── plan.md
│   └── log.md
├── refactor-auth-flow/
│   ├── plan.md
│   └── log.md
└── migrate-to-foundation-ui/
    ├── plan.md
    └── log.md
```

Use lowercase kebab-case for directory names. Prefix with type: `feat-`, `refactor-`, `fix-`, `migrate-`, `perf-`.

## plan.md Template

```markdown
# {Title}

**Status**: draft | in-progress | completed | abandoned
**Created**: {date}
**Updated**: {date}
**Ticket**: {link if available}

## Context

Why this work is needed. Link to tickets, PRs, or discussions if available.

## Scope

**In scope:**
- ...

**Out of scope:**
- ...

## Design

Key decisions, approach, and trade-offs. Keep it concise — this is a working document, not an RFC.

## Test Plan

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

### Test Cases

**Happy path:**
- [ ] {test description}

**Edge cases:**
- [ ] {test description}

**Error cases:**
- [ ] {test description}

### Mocking Strategy
What needs to be mocked (APIs, services, modules) and at what level.

## Tasks

- [ ] Step 1
- [ ] Step 2
- [ ] Step 3

## Risks

- {Risk}: {mitigation}
```

### Guidelines

- The **Test Plan** feeds directly into TDD. Each test case becomes a Red-Green cycle.
- **Acceptance Criteria** define "done". The task is complete when all criteria are met and all tests pass.
- **Scope** prevents creep. If something is out of scope, it stays out — log it for a follow-up task.
- **Design** should explain trade-offs: what alternatives were considered and why this approach was chosen.
- **Risks** should include unknowns, dependencies on other teams, and anything that could block or derail the work.

## log.md Template

```markdown
# {Title} — Execution Log

## {date}

### Decisions
- {Decision made and why}

### Discoveries
- {Unexpected behavior, edge cases found}

### Issues
- {Errors encountered and resolution}

### Deviations
- {Changes from original plan and why}

### Rules Feedback
- {Any missing rules, wrong rules, new patterns, or skills discovered}
- {Suggested changes to ~/.ai-rules/ files — create, update, or delete}
```

### What goes in the log

- Key decisions made during implementation (and why)
- Discoveries — unexpected behavior, edge cases found
- Errors encountered and how they were resolved
- Deviations from the original plan
- Context that helps someone (or a future AI session) pick up the work

### What does NOT go in the log

- Verbose terminal output (that's what the terminal is for)
- Every file touched (that's what git is for)
- Routine task completion updates (check off tasks in `plan.md` instead)

---

## Workflow

1. **Create the plan before writing code.** Share with the user for approval on complex tasks.
2. **Write the test plan first.** This drives the TDD workflow — each test case becomes a failing test.
3. **Update plan.md as you go.** Check off completed tasks, update status.
4. **Write to log.md during execution.** Capture decisions, discoveries, and deviations as they happen.
5. **Read both files at the start of each session.** If resuming work, read existing plan and log to restore context.
6. **Retrospective before closing.** Reflect on the rules (see `planning.mdc` Retrospective section). Log feedback in `log.md` under `### Rules Feedback`. Share suggestions with the user.
7. **Mark completed when done.** Set status to `completed`, ensure all acceptance criteria and tasks are checked off.

---

## Rules

- Plans are working documents, not permanent artifacts. Don't over-polish them.
- One plan per initiative. Don't create a plan for each sub-task.
- If the plan changes significantly, update it — don't create a new one. Log the change in `log.md`.
- Plans should be readable by the user and by future AI sessions picking up the work.
